## DOCS
Here you will find the stuff that we will have to add in our docs:

### Create a new user:
Use the following command to create a new user.
```bash
sudo adduser mythicalsystems
```
### Add the user to the sudo group:
The sudo group allows users to run commands with administrative privileges.
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo mythicalsystems
```
### Edit the sudoers file:
The sudoers file is the configuration file for controlling sudo privileges. We'll use the `visudo` command to safely edit it:

### Allow passwordless sudo for the new user:
Inside the sudoers file, add the following line at the end of the file:
```bash
mythicalsystems ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
